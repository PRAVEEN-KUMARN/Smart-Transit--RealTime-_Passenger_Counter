# Smart-Transit--RealTime-_Passenger_Counter
In the quest to enhance public transport efficiency and passenger convenience, accurate real-time passenger counting is vital. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model designed to count the number of passengers boarding a bus. The proposed system utilizes advanced object detection algorithms to identify and tally passengers as they enter through the bus gate. By integrating this counting system with a communication network, the passenger count can be relayed to the website created for passengers, improving operational planning and passenger experience. This literature survey reviews recent advancements in machine learning and computer vision techniques relevant to real-time people counting, identifying key methodologies, challenges, and gaps in current research. The insights gained aim to inform the development and implementation of an effective passenger counting system.


OBJECTIVE:
To design the system to perform reliably in various environments, including different lighting conditions, bus sizes, and passenger densities.
To ensure the system is compatible with current bus station technologies and can be easily integrated into existing setups.
To Offer passengers a up-to-date information on bus occupancy, enabling them to make informed travel decisions.
Implementing measures to ensure that passenger data is handled securely and in compliance with privacy regulations.
Implementing a system that can accurately detect and count passengers as they board a bus, providing real-time data to passengers.
